Let's rewind a bit and explore my roots, back to my childhood days when curiosity was my middle name! I was that kid who just couldn't resist taking things apart, always itching to see what made them tick. The problem was, I never quite mastered the art of putting them back together again in one piece. Let's just say I left a trail of broken gadgets in my wake, but hey, at least I satisfied my insatiable thirst for knowledge!

Oh, and let me tell you about my wanderlust. I had this burning desire to explore every nook and cranny of the world, and lucky me, I grew up in a country that was an absolute paradise for adventure, Nepal. With majestic mountains towering over me and breathtaking sceneries at every turn, I couldn't help but develop the mantra, "the next corner will always have better views." It was a mindset that fueled my love for discovering new places and at times helped me through some difficult patches in life. And you know what? As time went on, I did learn a thing or two about putting things back together—figuratively, of course. It was then that I made a decision. I knew deep down in my tinkering heart that I wanted to become an engineer

So, after completing school and my A-Levels from home, I left my beloved country and went to India to earn my bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering. Here I spent four exciting years honing my technical skills while also travelling around a country with a rich and vibrant culture. It was during the engineering years that I narrowed my areas of interest into computers networks and then finally Cyber Security.

Now I live in the UK and with a Master's degree from the University of Plymouth under my belt I consider myself a Cyber Security professional. It was an incredible journey where I spent some serious time honing my skills and diving deep into the fascinating world of cybersecurity. After conquering my Master's degree, I decided to take things up another notch. I'm currently knee-deep in pursuit of a PhD at the same University of Plymouth, because, hey, when you love what you do, why not take it to the next level, right?

I will strive to document my learning process every step of the way. I hope to learn and also teach from my encounters with cutting-edge tech, and I'll share my triumphs, challenges, and insights along the road. My aim is to create an open and engaging space where we can learn, grow, and evolve together. And you know what?
